#Improved ask method. That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you
#could do better. Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. Youâ€™ll
#have to use return to exit from the loop. (Well, it will get you out of the
#whole method, but it will get you out of the loop in the process.) How do
#you like the resulting method? I usually try to avoid using return (a personal
#preference), but I might make an exception here.
